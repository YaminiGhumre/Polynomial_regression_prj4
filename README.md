Objextive :Let’s assume the above table is what the HR team of a company uses to determine what salary to offer to a new employee. For our project, let’s take an example that an employee has applied for the role of a Regional Manager and has already worked as a Regional Manager for 2 years. So based on the table above — he falls between level 6 and level 7 — Lets say he falls at level 6.5

Process :
Step 1: Load the Dataset
Step 2: Fit Linear Regression model to dataset
Step 3: Visualize Linear Regression Results
Step 4: Predict Linear Regression Results
