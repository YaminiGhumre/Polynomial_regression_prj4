Objextive :Let’s assume the above table is what the HR team of a company uses to determine what salary to offer to a new employee. For our project, let’s take an example that an employee has applied for the role of a Regional Manager and has already worked as a Regional Manager for 2 years. So based on the table above — he falls between level 6 and level 7 — Lets say he falls at level 6.5

Process :
Step 1: Load the Dataset

Step 2: Fit Linear Regression model to dataset

Step 3: Visualize Linear Regression Results

Step 4: Predict Linear Regression Results

Step 5: Convert X to polynomial format

Step 6: Fitting Polynomial Regression

Step 7: Visualize Poly Regression Results

Step 8: Predict Polynomial Regression Results

Step 8: Predict Polynomial Regression Results

Step 9 — Change degree to 3




Result : The predicted salary of a person at 6.5 Level is 133259.46969697
